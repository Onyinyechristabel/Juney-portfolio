            I am Jones Oguadinma Jachimike, and I enjoy simplifying digital
            experiences that cater to the needs of end-users through my designs.
          </h3>
          <h3 className="about__p2">
            With over 2+ years of experience, I've designed industry-standard
            products for growing companies. In addition to my design expertise,
            I'm also a marketing strategist and proficient in no-code
            development with Framer. This combination provides me with a unique
            perspective when it comes to problem solving.
          </h3>
          <h3 className="about__p3">
            I usually adapt to evolving design trends, technologies, and project
            requirements. I successfully navigate challenges by adjusting my
            strategies, or learning new tools to ensure project success and
            innovation for your project.
          </h3>
          <h3 className="about__p4">
            When I'm not engrossed in creative pursuits, you'll find me dancing,
            seeing a movie, playing video games or indulging in curious
            "YouTube" searches on topics my mates would find weird.
          </h3>
          <h3 className="about__p5">
            I'm currently based in Enugu, Nigeria, and I'm open to relocating
            for exciting opportunities. I'd love to hear more about your
            project.
